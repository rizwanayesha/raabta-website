  <h1>Communication is a basic human right</h1>
  <p>
    Raabta was created to ensure that no person is excluded from education,
    healthcare, relationships, or opportunity simply because they communicate differently.

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Over 1 in 5 people worldwide experience communication challenges due to
      conditions such as autism, stroke, cerebral palsy, hearing impairments,
      or developmental delays.
    </p>

    <p>
      Existing AAC tools are often expensive, complex, language-limited,
      and culturally disconnected. Many families and therapists struggle to
      find solutions that are affordable, intuitive, and adaptable to real-life situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result? Individuals are unable to express pain, emotions, needs,
      or thoughts — not because they lack intelligence, but because they lack a voice.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world where communication differences never limit a person’s
      independence, dignity, or participation in society.
    </p>

    <p>
      Raabta aims to become a global communication bridge used in classrooms,
      homes, hospitals, workplaces, and emergency settings. Enabling the speech deficit community
      to express themselves confidently everywhere.
