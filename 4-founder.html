<h1>Meet the Founder</h1>

<p>
Hello, I’m Ayesha Rizwan Khan, a 23-year-old healthcare professional turned technology enthusiast, driven by a deep commitment to promoting inclusivity through Raabta. What began as an interest in bridging gaps in communication has evolved into a purpose-led mission: to empower individuals with speech deficits and ensure they are seen, heard, and understood. I do not view Raabta merely as a product that fills a market need, but as a meaningful tool designed to restore dignity, independence, and connection for underserved communities.
</p>

<p>
Alongside my healthcare background, I bring four years of international experience as an ESL tutor, where I worked with learners from diverse cultural and linguistic environments. This experience helped me recognize that communication challenges often extend far beyond language differences. I witnessed firsthand how expression, confidence, and comprehension barriers can shape a person’s ability to participate fully in education, work, and social life.
</p>

<p>
During the clinical testing phase of Raabta, I had the opportunity to engage closely with individuals experiencing a wide range of speech impairments and their families. These interactions were deeply eye-opening. I observed the emotional and practical struggles faced by parents and caregivers who longed to understand their loved ones but were limited by communication barriers. It became clear that the challenge was not only personal but systemic. Many of these individuals are still denied access to mainstream education and fair employment opportunities simply because they cannot communicate in conventional ways.
</p>

<p>
These experiences strengthened my resolve to build Raabta not just as a technological solution, but as a platform for inclusion, accessibility, and social change, one that advocates for the right of every individual to communicate, learn, and contribute with dignity.
</p>

<p>
Five years from now, I aspire to integrate Raabta into classrooms, hospital emergencies, and collaborative work environments. I envision a world where individuals are never excluded simply because they cannot communicate in traditional ways.
