<h1>The Story Behind Raabta</h1>

<p>
Hello, I’m Ayesha Rizwan Khan, a 23-year-old healthcare professional turned technology enthusiast, driven by a mission to promote inclusivity through Raabta. I don’t just see Raabta as a product that fills a market gap — I see it as a tool to empower underserved communities with speech deficits.
</p>

<p>
Five years from now, I aspire to integrate Raabta into classrooms, hospital emergencies, and collaborative work environments. I envision a world where individuals are never excluded simply because they cannot communicate in traditional ways.
